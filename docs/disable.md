# Disable Enemies To Reveal Enemies

## Playable Builds

This game was made as part of a game jam in a day. The idea of the jam was that you could pick an episode title of a certain podcast and have that be the theme for your game. This is why I entered because I thought it was a really interesting idea as it made for some very wierd and wonderful themes. That is why the game is so bizare.

## Details

I remember that it also turned out to be a really hard game. I also remeber that one way I was able to make the game in such a short period of time was by using part of the open source Spelunky level generation code plus some platformer asset pack I got off the GameMaker store then just tweak them and thread them together to fit my idea.

It's pretty rough but considering how quickly it was made I think it's pretty cool.

Another detail I remember is that the jam was on a weekend and you were supposed to have all weekend. However at the time I was also working a game dev day job where I was crunching to finish a browser puzzle game for a client and I literally finished coding for my day job even though it was the weekend and I wasn't supposed to be working. Wrapped up the finished project, then fired up GameMaker and made this.

I had a friend coming over at the time and they literally had to watch me frantically hammer out my submission, hit submit then we went about the rest of our weekend.

Disable Enemies To Reveal Enemies - for the Idle Thumbs Wizard Jam!!

I don't know what to say. I made this game today on the day of submission. good luck everyone!

I have never done a jam before.

Recommend playing with an xbox controller.

It's an endless perma-death procedural dungeon crawl.

Score points by getting to the end of the level.

But watch out! some enemies appear as ghosts. Enabling and disabling enemies via the debug console will show the hidden enemies and hide the visible enemies. Disabled enemies can still kill you.
