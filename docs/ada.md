## Original Text From The Itch.io Page 

Hey, I'm Nick. I made this game for PirateSoftware Game Jam 15. Except for the extra challenge I made it in 7 days instead of 14. It's also a gameboy game I made in GB Studio that can run on a real gameboy. See video for example of it running on a GameBoy.

You play as Ada an aspiring alchemist at the Alchemy Academy. However unfortunately Ada's studies have been cut short via an invasion of goblins. Ada must find ingredients to craft potions that when thrown in the right spot will create shadows that will help you sneak around and escape the goblin threat.

Runs on mobile BTW.
Theme (Shadows & Alchemy)

This is literally a game about brewing potions that make shadows.
