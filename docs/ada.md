# Ada's Alchemy Academy: Shadowy Help In Terror

![](images/ada.gif)

This game was made a part of a game jam I entered in 2024. The themes were "Alchemy" and "Shadows". I took the themes extremely literally and made a game where you crafted potions that created shadows.

The coolest thing about this game is that it is an actual gameboy game that I got running on an actualy gameboy game on the end. Made in GB Studio.

I also remember that the jam was two weeks long but I decided to do it in one for the extra challenge.


## Playable Builds & Source Code

This game had two playable builds. A GameBoy ROM version that is playable on a real GameBoy via a flash cart or via an emulator. It also had a browser version. As for source code the original GB Studio project is also avaliable.

## Original Text From The Itch.io Page 

Hey, I'm Nick. I made this game for PirateSoftware Game Jam 15. Except for the extra challenge I made it in 7 days instead of 14. It's also a gameboy game I made in GB Studio that can run on a real gameboy. See video for example of it running on a GameBoy.

You play as Ada an aspiring alchemist at the Alchemy Academy. However unfortunately Ada's studies have been cut short via an invasion of goblins. Ada must find ingredients to craft potions that when thrown in the right spot will create shadows that will help you sneak around and escape the goblin threat.

Runs on mobile BTW.
Theme (Shadows & Alchemy)

This is literally a game about brewing potions that make shadows.
