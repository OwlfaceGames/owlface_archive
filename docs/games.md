This game was made a part of a game jam I entered in 2024. The themes were "Alchemy" and "Shadows". I took the themes extremely literally and made a game where you crafted potions that created shadows.

The coolest thing about this game is that it is an actual gameboy game that I got running on an actualy gameboy game on the end. Made in GB Studio.

I also remember that the jam was two weeks long but I decided to do it in one for the extra challenge.

### Disable Enemies To Reveal Enemies (Est. 2016)

This game was made as part of a game jam in a day. The idea of the jam was that you could pick an episode title of a certain podcast and have that be the theme for your game. This is why I entered because I thought it was a really interesting idea as it made for some very wierd and wonderful themes. 

That is why the game is so bizare. I remember that it also turned out to be a really hard game. I also remeber that one way I was able to make the game in such a short period of time was by using part of the open source Spelunky level generation code plus some platformer asset pack I got off the GameMaker store then just tweak them and thread them together to fit my idea.

It's pretty rough but considering how quickly it was made I think it's pretty cool.

### Medieval Dungeon Throwdown (Est. 2013)

This is one of the first games I ever made. It was made specifically as a portfolio piece at the time to show potential employers. It was made in 24 hours right before a job application, which was successful.

It is a little arcade style mini game that for whatever reason I decided should have a film grain effect complete with vinyl crackle. Considering it was so early on I think it's kinda of interesting that it does have a cohesive aesthetic.

This game was probably made less than twelve months after I starting trying to teach myself how to make games.
