# Archived Owlface Games

## Welcome

Welcome to the Owlface Archive. A place where you can find many past projects by me, Nick aka OwlfaceGames on [GitHub](https://github.com/OwlfaceGames). If you would like to hear more about the intended purpose of this site see the [About](./about.md) page.

Some of the games in this archive are unfinished projects, prototypes and/or jam games. Many are projects from 13+ years ago when I first started learning how to make games. They are included here with the intention of preservation and transparency in regard to my game dev career and, ideally to be helpful in some way to others just starting out.

::: warning
Much of the code and basically all of the games here are old and bad. Proceed at your own peril.

You have been warned.

## Useful Info

This page is primarily intended as a list of all of the included games in the archive. Each game will also have it's own page with a more detailed description, controls (if it's playable), a link to source code (if included) and a link to any binaries (if included).

If there is a browser build avaliable it will be playable on the games page.

::: tip
You can find downloadable binaries for games as GitHub [releases](https://github.com/OwlfaceGames/owlface_archive/releases) and any game source code in the [source_code](https://github.com/OwlfaceGames/owlface_archive/tree/master/source_code) folder in the repo.

## A Final Warning

There will be bugs, performance issues and given the age of some of these binaries potential compatability issues. Lastly remember to check game pages for controls.

::: danger
There will be bugs.

## Game List

### [Adaâ€™s Alchemy Academy: Shadowy Help In Terror](./ada.md)


![Gif of Adas Alchemy Academy](images/ada.gif)

This game was made a part of a game jam I entered in 2024. The themes were "Alchemy" and "Shadows". I took the themes extremely literally and made a game where you crafted potions that created shadows.

The coolest thing about this game is that it is an actual gameboy game that I got running on an actualy gameboy game on the end. Made in GB Studio.

I also remember that the jam was two weeks long but I decided to do it in one for the extra challenge.
