### Adaâ€™s Alchemy Academy: Shadowy Help In Terror

This game was made a part of a game jam I entered in 2024. The themes were "Alchemy" and "Shadows". I took the themes extremely literally and made a game where you crafted potions that created shadows.

The coolest thing about this game is that it is an actual gameboy game that I got running on an actualy gameboy game on the end. Made in GB Studio.

I also remember that the jam was two weeks long but I decided to do it in one for the extra challenge.
