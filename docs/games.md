# Archived Owlface Games

## Welcome

Welcome to the Owlface Archive. A place where you can find many past projects by me, Nick aka OwlfaceGames on [GitHub](https://github.com/OwlfaceGames). If you would like to hear more about the intended purpose of this site see the [About](./about.md) page.

Some of the games in this archive are unfinished projects, prototypes and/or jam games. Many are projects from 13+ years ago when I first started learning how to make games. They are included here with the intention of preservation and transparency in regard to my game dev career and, ideally to be helpful in some way to others just starting out.

::: warning
Much of the code and basically all of the games here are old and bad. Proceed at your own peril.

You have been warned.

## Useful Info

This page is primarily intended as a list of all of the included games in the archive. Each game will also have it's own page with a more detailed description, controls (if it's playable), a link to source code (if included) and a link to any binaries (if included).

If there is a browser build avaliable it will be playable on the games page.

This is a tip.
