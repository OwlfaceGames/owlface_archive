# Archived Owlface Games

::: warning
Some of the games in this archive are unfinished projects, prototypes and/or jam games. Many are projects from 13+ years ago when I first started learning how to make games. They are included here with the intention of preservation and transparency in regard to my game dev career and, ideally to be helpful in some way to others just starting out.

Much of the code and basically all of the games are bad.

You have been warned.
