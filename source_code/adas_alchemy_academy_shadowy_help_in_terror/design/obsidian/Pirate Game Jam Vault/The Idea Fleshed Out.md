Top down 2d game boy game.

Maybe in this game you play a character that is basically useless.

The one thing this character is actually good at for some bizarre reason is making potions.

Except they aren't that good at that either because for whatever reason every potion they make just creates a shadow.

Perhaps depending on the ingredients the shadow could behave differently.

Maybe the shadow created by the potions reduce the visibility of anyone inside it.

There are environments filled with nasty enemies/monster that the player cannot defeat.

Therefore must somehow get around.

The only way around an enemy is to create a potion and use it in the right spot/spots.
