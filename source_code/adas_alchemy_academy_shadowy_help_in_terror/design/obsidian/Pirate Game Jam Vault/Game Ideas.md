#Ideas

## Theme
### Shadows and Alchemy
 - creating potions
 - different ingredients
 - stealth
 - sneaky
 - secret

## Criteria
### Playability
- Were systems in your game clunky or polished?
- Was the game tripping over itself when the judges tried to play it?
- Focus on playability and make sure your build works.
- This is the most important category and counts for a lot.
### Theme Implementation
- Did your game follow the theme?
- Was the theme entirely ignored?
- Did you implement the theme in a clever and interesting way?
### Cleverness
- Did you have an ingenious mechanic in your game?
- Maybe you told a story with a very interesting or unique twist.
- The more clever you are the more likely you are to win.
### Artistic Style
- Everyone has a style that they like or enjoy.
- Style is not bound only to Triple A assets from major studios.
- Pixel Art, Midi Songs, Foley work and more all ooze with artistic style.
- Just make something YOU think works and run with it.
### Judges Choice
- Every judge is different and games are subjectively valuable.
- Each judge is free to vote how they wish and they may find gems that are special to them.
- This category is for each judges favorite games to add extra weight to them.

#### Most literal idea
Making potions that create shadows to sneak through.
- potions made with ingredients found in surroundings

#### How Could We Do This in Game Maker
Could do any version of this idea

#### How could we do this in GB Studio
In GB studio we'd be limited to what the gameboy can do.

How could this work on gameboy:
- collecting loot to use for potion ingredients
- throwing potions/shooting potions
- could create shadows by retiling background in aoe of potion
	- this could work by having bright colour in palette for environment and dark colour for shadow tiles to create contrast when retiling
