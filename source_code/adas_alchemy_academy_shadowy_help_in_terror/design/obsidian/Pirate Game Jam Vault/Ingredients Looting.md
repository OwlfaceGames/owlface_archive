## How Shall We Loot?
- pick loose ingredients up off the ground
- loot chest - chests contain random loot
- loot random containers like chests, drawers, cupboards - they all contain random loot
- all of the above i.e. ingredients could be on the ground or in various containers

# Idea
Maybe how you find ingredients is:
	you go into a room and on entry game becomes a point and click adventure.
	you have to find the right things to click on to find the potion ingredients.
	options could be as follows:
		- loose ingredient on a shelf
		- chest, box or cupboard
		- or hidden in a cup
		- or any irl container

## How Easy Is This Idea To Do:
- dev wise its probably the easiest thing ever
- BUT it may require a lot more pixel to be created AND be good
