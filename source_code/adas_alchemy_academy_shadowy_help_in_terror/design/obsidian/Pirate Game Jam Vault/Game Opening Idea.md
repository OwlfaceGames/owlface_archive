#Ideas #Opening #GDD
If the way the game works is you have to explore rooms and figure out where potion ingredients are being hidden then the following could be a great opening to the game:

Player character wakes up in her bed to some loud noises/commotion.

She says "whats that noise?"

"It's coming from out side. I should go and investigate."

Player goes outside and sees a scary goblin and that the alchemy academy is now deserted.

Player character says, "I should go inside and look for some ingredients to make a potion. It's the only way I can sneak past. I can investigate with A."

Player is then exposed to ingredient looting mechanic. Via a hidden ingredient in the player characters bedroom.

Once the first ingredient is found.

Player character says, "I should get to the nearest brewing station. That way I can turn this into a potion. And a potion is the only way out of here."

Player then has to explore outside to find a brewing station.

Potion crafted at station.

When potion is crafted for the first time player character says, "I should be able to throw this with B".
